During each session we record and fully annotate, user`s EEG functionality, facial keypoints, real-time self-reports on cognitive fatigue, as well as detailed information of the performance metrics achieved during the cognitive task (success rate, response time, number of errors etc.). Along with the dataset we provide a baseline Machine Learning analysis towards predicting cognitive fatigue and our multi-modal implementation of the WCST, to allow other researches expand or modify the functionalities of the CogBeacon data-collection framework.
