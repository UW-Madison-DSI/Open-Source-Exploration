Metode Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) merupakan metode untuk mendiagnosis kanker payudara yang saat ini paling disukai karena mudah dilakukan, aman, dan murah tetapi tingkat akurasinya masih bervariasi. Oleh sebab itu, dibutuhkan algoritme yang dapat mendiagnosis tes FNA dengan akurasi yang tinggi. Penggunaan machine learning saat ini lagi tren digunakan oleh kalangan peneliti untuk melakukan klasifikasi atau prediksi penyakit. Algoritme Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Backpropagation merupakan algoritme yang memiliki akurasi yang cukup baik tetapi memiliki waktu komputasi yang cukup lama. Penggunaan seleksi fitur untuk memilih fitur terbaik mampu meningkatkan akurasi dan mempercepat waktu komputasi. Chi-Square adalah seleksi fitur yang mampu menghilangkan fitur noise dan memilih fitur terbaik. Oleh karena itu, penelitian ini menggunakan kombinasi algoritme ANN Backpropagation dan Chi-Square untuk melakukan klasifikasi kanker payudara menggunakan Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa kombinasi algoritme ANN Backpropagation dengan Chi-Square mampu melakukan klasifikasi/prediksi kanker payudara dengan sangat baik. Arsitektur atau model terbaik kombinasi ANN dengan Chi-Square yaitu 15 input layer, 1 hidden layer 10 node, dan 2 ouput layer dengan menggunakan 150 epoch. Arsitektur tersebut memiliki performa terbaik dengan nilai accuracy sebesar 96,49%, precision 100%, recall 94,36%, f1-score 97,10% dan AUC 97,18%.

The 19-year-old sophomore  who had beat childhood cancer  was due to study at John Cabot University, a small Rome-based liberal arts college.  Solomon`s body was found in the Tiber River on Monday.  The visiting student from the University of Wisconsin-Madison was last seen around 1 a.m. on Friday (7 p.m. ET Thursday) while at a pub in Rome. He had arrived in the city only hours earlier.  Solomon`s roommate became ""worried when he did not see Beau at orientation"" later in the day, John Cabot University said in a statement issued Sunday.  Investigators identified the accused as Massimo Galioto, a 40-year-old homeless man. He was being charged with ""aggravated murder,"" a police spokesman told NBC News.  Related: Studying Abroad Can Be Deadly, Grieving Moms Warn  After the disappearance, Solomon`s parents called their son`s credit card company and ""realized thousands of dollars had been charged"" in Milan to his account, according to his brother Jake Solomon. Milan is about 350 miles north of Rome.    On Monday, another brother had told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the teen`s body had been found with a head wound and blood on his shirt.  ""It`s a murder investigation,"" Cole Solomon told the newspaper before the arrest was made.  The personal finance major had been due to participate in a study abroad program. His parents arrived in Italy Monday, according to Jake Solomon. """"We generally feel safe, but we`ll be extra cautious now.""""  U.S. Ambassador to Italy John Phillips sent his condolences to Solomon`s family on Tuesday.  ""I was saddened to learn of the tragic death of Beau Solomon,"" he said in a statement. ""My heart goes out to his family and friends. The U.S. Embassy stands ready to provide support to Italian authorities investigating his disappearance and death.""  Abby Liles, who also traveled to Rome to study at John Cabot University, told NBC News she was shocked by his death.  ""It`s very sad, especially for the family,"" the South Carolina native said. ""We generally feel safe, but we`ll be extra cautious now.""  Back in Wisconsin, friends and family remembered Solomon as popular, outgoing and brave. ""He`s an amazing kid,"" Jake Solomon told NBC News before Beau`s body was discovered. ""Social butterfly, loved by everyone. He`s the glue that keeps our family together.""  Cole Solomon, meanwhile, recalled his little brother`s courage during his battle against cancer.  ""He had over 15 to 20 procedures growing up throughout his life and was able to overcome all that,"" he said.  Dozens gathered at River Valley High School in Spring Green, Wisconsin, for a candlelight vigil to remember Solomon on Monday night. They lit candles and took a lap around the football field where Solomon was a quarterback, according to NBC affiliate WMTV",NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,2016

The performance of the model have been  visualized in this project.  Problem statement: The full form of XGBoost is eXtreme Gradient Boosting, also called winner for several kaggle competetion machine learning model. Most of the literatues of Machine Learning found in google has described this model as having best accuracy, efficient and feasibility. It is a decision-tree-based ensemble ML algorithm based on gradient boosting framework. It is considered that XGBoost provides a convenient way of cross-validation. Cross-validation technique is applied to test the model`s overfitting during the training phase. If the model gives good accuracy in training dataset but the model works very poor in testing unseen dataset then it is called overfitting or a model of low bias and high variance. I have to calculate the model training and testing errors with different learning rates.As we know that the best technique to choose the learning rate value is between 0 and 1. I will be going to start the test by putting the learning rate as 0.01. It would easy to see the results through good visualization. I am also going to visualize the training and testing errors and accuracies by making a graph. Finally, I will tune the hyperparameters which helps us predict the testing datasets i.e. x_test.

As given by MayoClinic, the steps are as follows: breast exam, mammogram, breast ultrasound, removing a sample of breast cells for testing (biopsy) and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Understanding the result from all of these sources to analyze is very time-consuming. With human errors, these predictions might not be very accurate. Therefore, our team came up with a novel way to detect breast cancer using machine learning. Utilizing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer and IBM SPSS, we created a decision tree module that can assist researchers in automating the process of determining which tissues are malignant and benign. We use the decision tree as a classifier to determine what tissue is malignant or benign. Before we jump into the decision tree, we must first characterize what is considered to be benign or malignant. ",NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,2021

In this project, we have used certain classification methods such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is a supervised learning method to detect breast cancer. Cancer diagnosis is one of the most studied problems in the medical domain. Several researchers have focused in order to improve performance and achieved to obtain satisfactory results. Early detection of cancer is essential for a rapid response and better chances of cure. Unfortunately, early detection of cancer is often difcult because the symptoms of the disease at the beginning are absent. Thus, it is necessary to discover and interpret new knowledge to prevent and minimize the risk adverse consequences.  To understand this problem more precisely, tools are needed to help oncologists to choose the treatment required for healing or prevention of recurrence by reducing the harmful effects of certain treatments and their costs. In articial intelligent, machine learning is a discipline which allows the machine to evolve through a process. Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset obtained by the university of Wisconsin Hospital is used to classify tumors as benign or malignant.  #k- Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classification technique:  k-NN is a non- parametric method used for classification. In this classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. It is the simplest algorithm among all the machine learning algorithms.  #Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification Technique:  Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well  #Outcome  It can be seen that as the training data size increases, SVM performs better than kNN and has more accuracy.  kNN is quite a good classifier but its performance depends on the value of k. It gives poor results for lower values of k and best results as the value of k increases.  PCA is more sensitive to SVM than kNN .As the value of Principle Component (PC) is increased, SVM gives better results and accuracy score is more than kNN.",NULL,"Jupyter Notebook",0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,2846,0,0,2022

During each session we record and fully annotate, user`s EEG functionality, facial keypoints, real-time self-reports on cognitive fatigue, as well as detailed information of the performance metrics achieved during the cognitive task (success rate, response time, number of errors etc.). Along with the dataset we provide a baseline Machine Learning analysis towards predicting cognitive fatigue and our multi-modal implementation of the WCST, to allow other researches expand or modify the functionalities of the CogBeacon data-collection framework.

A substantial number of BC patients experience metastasis which in turn leads to treatment failure and death. The survival rate has been significantly increased thanks to the state of the art technologies and detection tools. In this study, we cross-compared the application of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Discrete Cosine Transform, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, and Ensemble to diagnose BC metastasis. We further combined MLP with genetic algorithm (GA) as a hybrid method of intelligent analysis. The core data we used for comparison belonged to the images of both benign and malignant tumors and were taken from Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI repository.

We used the KNN algorithm to evaluate the performance of these dimensional reduction methods. KNN models were built both on the original dimension data sets and the dimensionally reduced data to classify digits in the MNIST data or patient`s cancer status in the WDBC data. And the difference in the results was used to evaluate the impact of reducing the dimensions on accuracy.  Reducing the dimensions of the MNIST handwritten digits data set, slightly improved the performance of the model`s classification rate as it increased by only **0.4** i.e. from **98.5%** to **98.9%** for the IsoMap reduction method. PCA and metric MDS did not improve the performance as it reduced from **98.5%** to **96.75** for both methods. For the breast cancer data set, the model`s performance only improved when PCA dimensionally reduced was considered. The model **100%** classified the patient`s breast cancer status. Other reduction methods did not increase or reduce the classification accuracy from ***92.04%*** which was obtained with original data.",NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,1670,0,0,2020

Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition  How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods youre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.  The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worlds largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.  If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implication",NULL,"Jupyter Notebook",0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,2021

Theres good reason few readers, even those well versed in Bradburys work, are unfamiliar with Dark Carnival: Arkham House, a small press out of Sauk City, Wisconsin, published the book in a modest run of 3,112 copies; the book went out of print just a few years later. Besides a pricey limited-edition reprint in 2001, Dark Carnival exists as a literary apparition.  And yet many people have read some of Dark Carnival without knowing it. In 1955, Ballantine Books published the now-classic collection of Bradburys gothic horror, The October Country, which celebrated its sixtieth anniversary on October 25, and many of the stories in the collection are reworkings of tales from Dark Carnival. When given the chance to rerelease the out-of-print collection in 1955, Bradbury seized the opportunity to revisit his first book and correct the things he deemed inadequate. (Ever the perfectionist, Bradbury was, throughout his career, often discontent with calling a book done, even after its publication.) He rewrote a number of stories, made light revisions on others, cut twelve tales altogether, and added four new ones to round out the collection. The stories Bradbury discarded he thought too weak, too violent, or too primitive, and not representative of where he was as a writer at that moment.",NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,2022

Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition  How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods youre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.  The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worlds largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.  If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implications.

Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition  How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods youre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.  The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worlds largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.  If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implications.

It starts developing when threatening bumps start forming from the breast cells, and unfortunately most diagnoses happen in later stages, thus resulting in low chances of survival for the patient. So for early detection and prognosis, it is necessary to detect the benign or threatening nature of the bumps. In this paper, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers are used to develop a machine learning (ML) model using the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer (WDBC) dataset, in order to evaluate the attributes of a breast cancer development at beginning phases and classify it as malignant or benign. In the proposed scheme, feature selection and feature extraction are done to extract statistical features from the dataset and comparison between the models is provided based on their performance to identify the most suitable approach for diagnosis. The dataset apportioned into various arrangements of train-test split. The presentation of the framework is estimated, depending on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall.

Les 3 parties sont comme suit:  Dans la premire partie, nous avons implmente un algorithme de slection d`attribut. tant donn un ensemble de donnes de  attributs, lalgorithme calcule simplement le rapport de gain de chacun des attributs et le conserve haut  les attributs. Cette partie devrait tre mise en uvre sur le jeu de donnes dchecs dAlen Shapiro.1 Dans ce ensemble de donnes, il y a 36 attributs, nos algorithmes ont donc choisir les 4 avec le gain le plus lev Ratio et stockez le jeu de donnes rsultant (avec seulement ces 4 attributs) dans un fichier spar.  Dans la deuxime partie, nous avons implmente lalgorithme de k-NN le plus proche pour la classification.  En utilisant la Distance euclidienne et k = 1 et nous avons appliquer notre  algorithme au Wisconsin pour le cancer du sein (diagnostic). Cependant, avant de mettre en uvre lalgorithme, nous avons divisez nos donnes en un ensemble dapprentissage et en un ensemble de test. Lensemble dentranement comprend 90% des premiers cas, alors que lensemble de test comprend des 10% restants. notre algorithme doit stocker ses prdictions dans un fichier spar et afficher la prcision de ces prdictions. Dans la dernire partie, nous avons  implmente une technique de clustering simple qui utilise deux versions de jeux de donnes du Diabte, une version discrtise et une version non discrtise (dorigine). Plus prcisment, nous utiliserons le jeu de donnes sur le diabte Indien Pima discrtis par mangrove.   Le jeu de donnes a de nombreux attributs, mais nous  nous concentrerons que sur 5 attributs non discrtiss (ge, IMC, glucose, insuline, grossesses) et 5 discrtises (LabelPAge, LabelPBMI, LabelPGlucose, LabelPInsulin, Labelpgrossesses). Ainsi la premire chose  faire est de supprimer tout sauf ces 10 attributs. Lalgorithme commence par calculer de la corrlation entre chaque paire dattributs non discrtiss et choisit le pair avec la corrlation la plus faible (c.--d., avec le coefficient de corrlation le plus proche de 0). Appelons cette paire AX et Ay. Ensuite, pour ces deux attributs, il cre un cluster pour chaque combinaison possible de valeurs pour les versions discrtises de AX et AY.  Par exemple, disons que la version discrtise de la hache a les valeurs haute et basse et la version discrtise day a les valeurs grandes et petites. Alors Il y aura les 4 clusters suivants: C1: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs haute et grande pour AX et AY, respectivement. C2: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs haute et petite pour AX et AY, respectivement. C3: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs basses et grandes pour AX et AY, respectivement. C4: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs basses et petites pour AX et AY, respectivement. Notre algorithme a du crer un fichier distinct contenant les enregistrements de chaque cluster. Elle  a galement valuer le regroupement rsultant en calculant la distance euclidienne maximale entre deux enregistrements dans le mme cluster et la distance euclidienne minimale entre deux enregistrements dans diffrents clusters. Notez que ces distances doivent tre calcules en fonction des 5 attributs non discrtiss.",NULL,"Jupyter Notebook",4,4,1,0,1,NULL,NULL,3361,0,0,2019

They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.  Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, ""Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming."" Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.  The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ""Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

Wolbergs office. Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. These are consecutive patients seen by Dr. Wolberg since 1984, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. This dataset contains 3 measures (mean, standard deviation, and worst) for 10 different cell features - radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. All these features have been computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass, and they describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Then, the tumor size represents the diameter of excised tumor in centimeters, and lymph node status indicates the number of positive axillary lymph nodes. Outcome column represents whether the tumor in a given patient was recurrent (R) or non-recurrent (N).

These tumors can start from different at different locations in the breast. However, the vast majority of breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancers). While, others can start in the glands that make breast milk (lobular cancers). There are also other types of breast cancer that are much less common. Tumors that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. A tumor is considered malignant (cancer) if the cells grow into (invade) surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.
