Metode Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) merupakan metode untuk mendiagnosis kanker payudara yang saat ini paling disukai karena mudah dilakukan, aman, dan murah tetapi tingkat akurasinya masih bervariasi. Oleh sebab itu, dibutuhkan algoritme yang dapat mendiagnosis tes FNA dengan akurasi yang tinggi. Penggunaan machine learning saat ini lagi tren digunakan oleh kalangan peneliti untuk melakukan klasifikasi atau prediksi penyakit. Algoritme Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Backpropagation merupakan algoritme yang memiliki akurasi yang cukup baik tetapi memiliki waktu komputasi yang cukup lama. Penggunaan seleksi fitur untuk memilih fitur terbaik mampu meningkatkan akurasi dan mempercepat waktu komputasi. Chi-Square adalah seleksi fitur yang mampu menghilangkan fitur noise dan memilih fitur terbaik. Oleh karena itu, penelitian ini menggunakan kombinasi algoritme ANN Backpropagation dan Chi-Square untuk melakukan klasifikasi kanker payudara menggunakan Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa kombinasi algoritme ANN Backpropagation dengan Chi-Square mampu melakukan klasifikasi/prediksi kanker payudara dengan sangat baik. Arsitektur atau model terbaik kombinasi ANN dengan Chi-Square yaitu 15 input layer, 1 hidden layer 10 node, dan 2 ouput layer dengan menggunakan 150 epoch. Arsitektur tersebut memiliki performa terbaik dengan nilai accuracy sebesar 96,49%, precision 100%, recall 94,36%, f1-score 97,10% dan AUC 97,18%.

The 19-year-old sophomore  who had beat childhood cancer  was due to study at John Cabot University, a small Rome-based liberal arts college.  Solomon`s body was found in the Tiber River on Monday.  The visiting student from the University of Wisconsin-Madison was last seen around 1 a.m. on Friday (7 p.m. ET Thursday) while at a pub in Rome. He had arrived in the city only hours earlier.  Solomon`s roommate became ""worried when he did not see Beau at orientation"" later in the day, John Cabot University said in a statement issued Sunday.  Investigators identified the accused as Massimo Galioto, a 40-year-old homeless man. He was being charged with ""aggravated murder,"" a police spokesman told NBC News.  Related: Studying Abroad Can Be Deadly, Grieving Moms Warn  After the disappearance, Solomon`s parents called their son`s credit card company and ""realized thousands of dollars had been charged"" in Milan to his account, according to his brother Jake Solomon. Milan is about 350 miles north of Rome.    On Monday, another brother had told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the teen`s body had been found with a head wound and blood on his shirt.  ""It`s a murder investigation,"" Cole Solomon told the newspaper before the arrest was made.  The personal finance major had been due to participate in a study abroad program. His parents arrived in Italy Monday, according to Jake Solomon. """"We generally feel safe, but we`ll be extra cautious now.""""  U.S. Ambassador to Italy John Phillips sent his condolences to Solomon`s family on Tuesday.  ""I was saddened to learn of the tragic death of Beau Solomon,"" he said in a statement. ""My heart goes out to his family and friends. The U.S. Embassy stands ready to provide support to Italian authorities investigating his disappearance and death.""  Abby Liles, who also traveled to Rome to study at John Cabot University, told NBC News she was shocked by his death.  ""It`s very sad, especially for the family,"" the South Carolina native said. ""We generally feel safe, but we`ll be extra cautious now.""  Back in Wisconsin, friends and family remembered Solomon as popular, outgoing and brave. ""He`s an amazing kid,"" Jake Solomon told NBC News before Beau`s body was discovered. ""Social butterfly, loved by everyone. He`s the glue that keeps our family together.""  Cole Solomon, meanwhile, recalled his little brother`s courage during his battle against cancer.  ""He had over 15 to 20 procedures growing up throughout his life and was able to overcome all that,"" he said.  Dozens gathered at River Valley High School in Spring Green, Wisconsin, for a candlelight vigil to remember Solomon on Monday night. They lit candles and took a lap around the football field where Solomon was a quarterback, according to NBC affiliate WMTV",NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,2016

It has df.shape=(569, 31) which means 569 rows and 32 columns.  + The link of the datset used  in this project is  -https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data + I am importing the important python packages- skelarn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to complete the project. + The machine learning models such as  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting classifier have been used. + The performance of the  machine learnig models have been tested on the basis of accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report, f1 score and roc auc score. + I had tuned hyperparameters  to improve the perforamnce for XGBoost model  + The good visualization is also important along with accuracy score in model building. The performance of the model have been  visualized in this project.  Problem statement: The full form of XGBoost is eXtreme Gradient Boosting, also called winner for several kaggle competetion machine learning model. Most of the literatues of Machine Learning found in google has described this model as having best accuracy, efficient and feasibility. It is a decision-tree-based ensemble ML algorithm based on gradient boosting framework. It is considered that XGBoost provides a convenient way of cross-validation. Cross-validation technique is applied to test the model`s overfitting during the training phase. If the model gives good accuracy in training dataset but the model works very poor in testing unseen dataset then it is called overfitting or a model of low bias and high variance. I have to calculate the model training and testing errors with different learning rates.As we know that the best technique to choose the learning rate value is between 0 and 1. I will be going to start the test by putting the learning rate as 0.01. It would easy to see the results through good visualization. I am also going to visualize the training and testing errors and accuracies by making a graph. Finally, I will tune the hyperparameters which helps us predict the testing datasets i.e. x_test.

We used the KNN algorithm to evaluate the performance of these dimensional reduction methods. KNN models were built both on the original dimension data sets and the dimensionally reduced data to classify digits in the MNIST data or patient`s cancer status in the WDBC data. And the difference in the results was used to evaluate the impact of reducing the dimensions on accuracy.  Reducing the dimensions of the MNIST handwritten digits data set, slightly improved the performance of the model`s classification rate as it increased by only **0.4** i.e. from **98.5%** to **98.9%** for the IsoMap reduction method. PCA and metric MDS did not improve the performance as it reduced from **98.5%** to **96.75** for both methods. For the breast cancer data set, the model`s performance only improved when PCA dimensionally reduced was considered. The model **100%** classified the patient`s breast cancer status. Other reduction methods did not increase or reduce the classification accuracy from ***92.04%*** which was obtained with original data.",NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,1670,0,0,2020

Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition  How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods youre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.  The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worlds largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.  If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implication",NULL,"Jupyter Notebook",0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,2021

Theres good reason few readers, even those well versed in Bradburys work, are unfamiliar with Dark Carnival: Arkham House, a small press out of Sauk City, Wisconsin, published the book in a modest run of 3,112 copies; the book went out of print just a few years later. Besides a pricey limited-edition reprint in 2001, Dark Carnival exists as a literary apparition.  And yet many people have read some of Dark Carnival without knowing it. In 1955, Ballantine Books published the now-classic collection of Bradburys gothic horror, The October Country, which celebrated its sixtieth anniversary on October 25, and many of the stories in the collection are reworkings of tales from Dark Carnival. When given the chance to rerelease the out-of-print collection in 1955, Bradbury seized the opportunity to revisit his first book and correct the things he deemed inadequate. (Ever the perfectionist, Bradbury was, throughout his career, often discontent with calling a book done, even after its publication.) He rewrote a number of stories, made light revisions on others, cut twelve tales altogether, and added four new ones to round out the collection. The stories Bradbury discarded he thought too weak, too violent, or too primitive, and not representative of where he was as a writer at that moment.",NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,2022

Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition  How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods youre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.  The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worlds largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.  If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implications.

Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition  How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods youre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.  The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worlds largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.  If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implications.

Les 3 parties sont comme suit:  Dans la premire partie, nous avons implmente un algorithme de slection d`attribut. tant donn un ensemble de donnes de  attributs, lalgorithme calcule simplement le rapport de gain de chacun des attributs et le conserve haut  les attributs. Cette partie devrait tre mise en uvre sur le jeu de donnes dchecs dAlen Shapiro.1 Dans ce ensemble de donnes, il y a 36 attributs, nos algorithmes ont donc choisir les 4 avec le gain le plus lev Ratio et stockez le jeu de donnes rsultant (avec seulement ces 4 attributs) dans un fichier spar.  Dans la deuxime partie, nous avons implmente lalgorithme de k-NN le plus proche pour la classification.  En utilisant la Distance euclidienne et k = 1 et nous avons appliquer notre  algorithme au Wisconsin pour le cancer du sein (diagnostic). Cependant, avant de mettre en uvre lalgorithme, nous avons divisez nos donnes en un ensemble dapprentissage et en un ensemble de test. Lensemble dentranement comprend 90% des premiers cas, alors que lensemble de test comprend des 10% restants. notre algorithme doit stocker ses prdictions dans un fichier spar et afficher la prcision de ces prdictions. Dans la dernire partie, nous avons  implmente une technique de clustering simple qui utilise deux versions de jeux de donnes du Diabte, une version discrtise et une version non discrtise (dorigine). Plus prcisment, nous utiliserons le jeu de donnes sur le diabte Indien Pima discrtis par mangrove.   Le jeu de donnes a de nombreux attributs, mais nous  nous concentrerons que sur 5 attributs non discrtiss (ge, IMC, glucose, insuline, grossesses) et 5 discrtises (LabelPAge, LabelPBMI, LabelPGlucose, LabelPInsulin, Labelpgrossesses). Ainsi la premire chose  faire est de supprimer tout sauf ces 10 attributs. Lalgorithme commence par calculer de la corrlation entre chaque paire dattributs non discrtiss et choisit le pair avec la corrlation la plus faible (c.--d., avec le coefficient de corrlation le plus proche de 0). Appelons cette paire AX et Ay. Ensuite, pour ces deux attributs, il cre un cluster pour chaque combinaison possible de valeurs pour les versions discrtises de AX et AY.  Par exemple, disons que la version discrtise de la hache a les valeurs haute et basse et la version discrtise day a les valeurs grandes et petites. Alors Il y aura les 4 clusters suivants: C1: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs haute et grande pour AX et AY, respectivement. C2: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs haute et petite pour AX et AY, respectivement. C3: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs basses et grandes pour AX et AY, respectivement. C4: avec des enregistrements contenant les valeurs basses et petites pour AX et AY, respectivement. Notre algorithme a du crer un fichier distinct contenant les enregistrements de chaque cluster. Elle  a galement valuer le regroupement rsultant en calculant la distance euclidienne maximale entre deux enregistrements dans le mme cluster et la distance euclidienne minimale entre deux enregistrements dans diffrents clusters. Notez que ces distances doivent tre calcules en fonction des 5 attributs non discrtiss.",NULL,"Jupyter Notebook",4,4,1,0,1,NULL,NULL,3361,0,0,2019

They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.  Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, ""Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming."" Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.  The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ""Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
