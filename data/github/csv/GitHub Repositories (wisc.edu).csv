They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.  Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, ""Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming."" Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.  The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ""Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
